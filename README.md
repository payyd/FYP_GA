# Abstract

This project applies real-life genetic properties to programming through the use of genetic algorithms to demonstrate an available learning process for artificial intelligences. The genetic algorithm will be applied to a self-programmed video game, where the games score increases incrementally as the game runs.

The outcome of this project is that a fully functional genetic algorithm was created and after a number of generations of reproduction, its fitness score increased. Furthermore, a playable video game with an appropriate user interface was created. Once the algorithm was competent, the mutation and population size parameters of the algorithm were be tweaked to examine which combinations give optimal results.

Once the algorithm was created, it was found that without the use of neural networks, the algorithmâ€™s performance was weaker than expected. However, through the manipulation of gameplay parameters, an algorithm existed which could complete the game.
